# Python bindings for NMSLIB


## Installation

This project works with Python on version 2.7+ and 3.5+, and on
Linux, OSX and the Windows operating systems. To install:

```
pip install nmslib
```

To install from sources:
```
pip install --no-binary :all: nmslib
```
To install from sources, you may need to install Python dev-files. On Ubuntu, you can do it as follows:

```
sudo apt-get install python3-dev
```

Building on Windows requires Visual Studio 2015, see this [project for more
information](https://github.com/pybind/python_example#installation).


## Example Usage

Here is a simple example, but we also have [Python notebooks with more elaborate end-to-end examples, which include even computation of gold-standard data](notebooks) (for both sparse and dense space):

```python
import nmslib
import numpy

# create a random matrix to index
data = numpy.random.randn(10000, 100).astype(numpy.float32)

# initialize a new index, using a HNSW index on Cosine Similarity
index = nmslib.init(method='hnsw', space='cosinesimil')
index.addDataPointBatch(data)
index.createIndex({'post': 2}, print_progress=True)

# query for the nearest neighbours of the first datapoint
ids, distances = index.knnQuery(data[0], k=10)

# get all nearest neighbours for all the datapoint
# using a pool of 4 threads to compute
neighbours = index.knnQueryBatch(data, k=10, num_threads=4)
```

## Saving Indexes and Data

It is possible to save both indexes (for some of the search methods) and serialized data in the binary format for subsequent faster loading. Then, one does not need to call `index.addDataPointBatch` and `index.createIndex`.  Instead, one can first call `index.saveIndex(indexLocation, save_data=True)` and then
```
index = nmslib.init(method='hnsw', space='cosinesimil')
index.loadIndex(indexLocal, load_data=True)
```
One **catch** though is that for spaces `l2` and `cosinesimil`, HNSW's method `saveIndex` always saves its own copy of data. In this case, we say that HNSW saves an **optimized** version of the index. Thus, to avoid data duplication one can set parameters of `save_data` and `load_data`  to false.  Examples of doing so can be found [in sample Python notebooks](/python_bindings/notebooks/README.md). Note, though, that the function `getDistance` will **not work properly unless the data is reloaded** (this is certainly a deficiency, but it is not easy to fix).

## Basic tuning guidelines

The basic parameter tuning/selection guidelines are available [here](/manual/methods.md).

## Logging

NMSLIB produces quite a few informational messages. By default, they are not shown in Python. To enable debugging, one should use the following commands **before** importing the library:

```
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

## Installing with Extras

To enable extra methods like those provided by FALCONN and LSHKIT you need to follow an extra couple steps.

These methods require a development version of the
following libraries: Boost, GNU scientific library, and Eigen3. To install on Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev libgsl0-dev libeigen3-dev
```

Next clone the repository and build with the C++ files using CMake:

```
cd similarity_search
cmake . -DWITH_EXTRAS=1
make
cd ..
```

Finally build and install the python extension:

```shell
$ cd python_bindings
$ pip install .
```
