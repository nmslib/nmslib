# Non-Metric Space Library (NMSLIB) 

## Important Notes

* NMSLIB is generic but fast, see the results of [ANN benchmarks](https://github.com/erikbern/ann-benchmarks).
* A standalone implementation of our fastest method HNSW [also exists as a header-only library](https://github.com/nmslib/hnswlib).
* **All the documentation** (including using **Python bindings** and the query server, description of methods and spaces, building the library, etc) can be found [on this page](/manual/README.md).
* For **generic questions/inquiries**, please, use [**the Gitter chat**](https://gitter.im/nmslib/Lobby?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge): GitHub issues page is for bugs and feature requests.

## Objectives

Non-Metric Space Library (NMSLIB) is an **efficient** cross-platform similarity search library and a toolkit for evaluation of similarity search methods. The core-library does **not** have any third-party dependencies. It has been gaining popularity recently. In particular, it has become a part of [Amazon Elasticsearch Service](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/03/build-k-nearest-neighbor-similarity-search-engine-with-amazon-elasticsearch-service/).

The goal of the project is to create an effective and **comprehensive** toolkit for searching in **generic and non-metric** spaces.
Even though the library contains a variety of metric-space access methods,
our main focus is on **generic** and **approximate** search methods,
in particular, on methods for non-metric spaces.
NMSLIB is possibly the first library with a principled support for non-metric space searching.

NMSLIB is an **extendible library**, which means that is possible to add new search methods and distance functions. NMSLIB can be used directly in C++ and Python (via Python bindings). In addition, it is also possible to build a query server, which can be used from Java (or other languages supported by Apache Thrift (**version 0.12**). Java has a native client, i.e., it works on many platforms without requiring a C++ library to be installed.

## Brief History

NMSLIB started as a personal project of Bilegsaikhan Naidan, who created the initial code base, the Python bindings,
and participated in earlier evaluations. 
The most successful class of methods--neighborhood/proximity graphs--is represented by the Hierarchical Navigable Small World Graph (HNSW) due to Malkov and Yashunin (see the publications below). Other most useful methods, include a modification of the VP-tree due to Boytsov and Naidan (2013), a Neighborhood APProximation index (NAPP) proposed by Tellez et al. (2013) and improved by David Novak, as well as a vanilla uncompressed inverted file.

## License

The code is released under the Apache License Version 2.0 http://www.apache.org/licenses/. 
Older versions of the library include additional components, which have different licenses (but this does not apply to NMLISB 2.x):

Older versions of the library included the following components:
* The LSHKIT, which is embedded in our library, is distributed under the GNU General Public License, see http://www.gnu.org/licenses/. 
* The k-NN graph construction algorithm *NN-Descent* due to Dong et al. 2011 (see the links below), which is also embedded in our library, seems to be covered by a free-to-use license, similar to Apache 2.
* FALCONN library's licence is MIT.
